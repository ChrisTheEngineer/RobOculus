#Before you run the code...
Files containing a description and details of the project are located in the [Documents](https://github.com/ChrisTheEngineer/RobOculus/tree/wheels/Documents) section.

*Download and install [OpenCV 2.4.11](http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/files/latest/download?source=files).Then add an environment variable to your system for OpenCV. Here is a [basic tutorial](http://opencv-srf.blogspot.com/2013/05/installing-configuring-opencv-with-vs.html), you only need to look at the "Steps to Set up Environmental Variable" section of the tutorial.

(Optional) Set your environment variable name to be "%OPENCV_DIR%" without the quotations to sync with our OpenCV folder shortcut and the Visual Studio properties file. 

*To interface with the Arduino board, install the [Arduino USB Driver](http://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software). The code files for the Arduino microcontrollers are located in the [Arduino](https://github.com/ChrisTheEngineer/RobOculus/tree/wheels/Arduino) section.
